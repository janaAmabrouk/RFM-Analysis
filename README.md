# **RFM Analysis**
# **Overview**
In this project, python will be used to analyze the RFM dataset and then express the results. Python libraries that will be used are NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn to make the analysis process easier.

This dataset was provided by an e-commerce platform and contains customer transaction data including customer ID, purchase date, transaction amount, product information, order ID, and location.

# **What do I need to install?**
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- CSV

Anaconda is the best program to use, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as Python notebook. Here are the installation steps:
<br>Download the installer from https://www.anaconda.com/download/. Choose the Python 3.6 or higher version and the appropriate 64/32-bit installer.
